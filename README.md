I am a professional Data Analyst who recently completed the SavvyCoders: Data Analysis + Python Bootcamp. I have over 10 years of statistical experience transforming raw science data into meaningful insights.
With learning Python, SQL, Git, Github, and Tableau, I can clean and visualize the data more effectively. 
Passionate about solving complex data problems.
Here's a bit about what I do and what I love in the realm of data engineering.

## Recent Project

### Chronic Diseases & their Indicators in the United States (2019-2022)

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/For7the7Research/Capstone.git) | [Tableau Presentation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ayana.scott.elliston/viz/Capstone_Presentation_17482711887780/ChronicDisease?publish=yes) | [Presentation to be Uploaded]

For my Savvy Coders Data Analytics + Python Bootcamp project, I analyzed Chronic Diseases in the United States from CDC data ranging from 2019 to 2022. What started as an investigation into Asthma prevalence in the United States turned into a deep dive into the startling prevalence of a multitude of Chronic Diseases throughout the United States.

Key Questions & Objectives:

What are the chronic diseases in the United States?
What are the prevalences for these chronic diseases?

Methodology & Skills Applied:

* Excel: Data wrangling
* SQL (SQLite): Data assessment and alternation
* Python (Pandas, NumPy): Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data assessment
* Tableau: Developed an interactive story composed of multiple dashboards demonstrating the prevalence of multiple chronic diseases in the United States
